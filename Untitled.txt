It is obvious that the great deal of work and attention has been done in order to answer to the referee report. I believe that all 3 of my main comments have been answered in a sufficient detail, and that the manuscript is now more understandable for the reader. I do think that the manuscript is now much stronger than at the time of the initial submission, and I hope that the authors found my suggestions helpful.
